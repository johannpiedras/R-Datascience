# Which Factors Influce the Price Of Health Insurance? 
First and foremost, this RMD file is inspired and founded thanks to a Python Notebook by mariapushkareva on Kaggle. The purpose here is to showcase an example of linear regression with medical data, but also to parallel data analysis from Python using R. \

With that out of the way lets, look at the insurance.csv file sourced from Kaggle. Although I don't know exactly where Kaggle got the csv from, the purpose derived from the data is is to attempt to understand what factors contribute to the cost of health insurance. 

## EDA

```{r}
# importing the data
df <- read.csv('insurance.csv', header = TRUE)
head(df)
```
